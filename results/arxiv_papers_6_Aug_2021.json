A universal tension between strength\nof proof-chain and privacy is then revealed and the zero-knowledge based\nproof-chain takes shape.

    "title": "Training Massive Deep Neural Networks in a Smart Contract: A New Hope",
    "summary": "Deep neural networks (DNNs) could be very useful in blockchain applications\nsuch as DeFi and NFT trading. However, training / running large-scale DNNs as\npart of a smart contract is infeasible on today's blockchain platforms, due to\ntwo fundamental design issues of these platforms. First, blockchains nowadays\ntypically require that each node maintain the complete world state at any time,\nmeaning that the node must execute all transactions in every block. This is\nprohibitively expensive for computationally intensive smart contracts involving\nDNNs. Second, existing blockchain platforms expect smart contract transactions\nto have deterministic, reproducible results and effects. In contrast, DNNs are\nusually trained / run lock-free on massively parallel computing devices such as\nGPUs, TPUs and / or computing clusters, which often do not yield deterministic\nresults.\n  This paper proposes novel platform designs, collectively called A New Hope\n(ANH), that address the above issues. The main ideas are (i)\ncomputing-intensive smart contract transactions are only executed by nodes who\nneed their results, or by specialized serviced providers, and (ii) a\nnon-deterministic smart contract transaction leads to uncertain results, which\ncan still be validated, though at a relatively high cost; specifically for\nDNNs, the validation cost can often be reduced by verifying properties of the\nresults instead of their exact values. In addition, we discuss various\nimplications of ANH, including its effects on token fungibility, sharding,\nprivate transactions, and the fundamental meaning of a smart contract.",

Liquidity\nproviders can be regarded as investors in the decentralized exchange and earn\nfixed commissions per trade. They lock up funds in liquidity pools for distinct\npairs of currencies allowing market participants to swap them using the fixed\nprice function. Liquidity providers take on market risk as a liquidity provider\nin exchange for earning commissions on each trade.

Debt is a popular form of leverage, and with over 39.88B USD of total\nvalue locked (TVL), the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending markets are\nthriving. Debts, however, entail the risks of liquidation, the process of\nselling the debt collateral at a discount to liquidators. Nevertheless, few\nquantitative insights are known about the existing liquidation mechanisms.\n  In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the\nbreadth of the borrowing and lending markets of the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem.

Being\nspecifically designated to arrange user transactions into blocks, miners can\neasily play the role of adversary, by suitably selecting and ordering\ntransactions - and possibly inserting their own - to increase their gain. In\nthis paper we formally characterize rational miners as players which follow an\noptimal strategy in the mining game.

    "summary": "The rapid growth of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) boosts the Ethereum\necosystem. At the same time, attacks towards DeFi applications (apps) are\nincreasing. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing smart contract\nvulnerability detection tools cannot be directly used to detect DeFi attacks.\nThat's because they lack the capability to recover and understand high-level\nDeFi semantics, e.g., a user trades a token pair X and Y in a Decentralized\nEXchange (DEX).\n  In this work, we focus on the detection of two types of new attacks on DeFi\napps, including direct and indirect price manipulation attacks. The former one\nmeans that an attacker directly manipulates the token price in DEX by\nperforming an unwanted trade in the same DEX by attacking the vulnerable DeFi\napp. The latter one means that an attacker indirectly manipulates the token\nprice of the vulnerable DeFi app (e.g., a lending app). To this end, we propose\na platform-independent way to recover high-level DeFi semantics by first\nconstructing the cash flow tree from raw Ethereum transactions and then lifting\nthe low-level semantics to high-level ones, including token trade, liquidity\nmining, and liquidity cancel. Finally, we detect price manipulation attacks\nusing the patterns expressed with the recovered DeFi semantics.\n  We have implemented a prototype named \\tool{} and applied it to more than 350\nmillion transactions. It successfully detected 432 real-world attacks in the\nwild. We confirm that they belong to four known security incidents and five\nzero-day ones. We reported our findings. Two CVEs have been assigned. We\nfurther performed an attack analysis to reveal the root cause of the\nvulnerability, the attack footprint, and the impact of the attack.

However, the open nature of DeFi inevitably introduces a large attack\nsurface, which is a severe threat to the security of participants funds. In\nthis paper, we proposed BLOCKEYE, a real-time attack detection system for DeFi\nprojects on the Ethereum blockchain. Key capabilities provided by BLOCKEYE are\ntwofold: (1) Potentially vulnerable DeFi projects are identified based on an\nautomatic security analysis process, which performs symbolic reasoning on the\ndata flow of important service states, e.g., asset price, and checks whether\nthey can be externally manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is\ninstalled offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project.

We first adopt the Bellman-Ford-Moore\nalgorithm with DEFIPOSER-ARB and then create logical DeFi protocol models for a\ntheorem prover in DEFIPOSER-SMT. While DEFIPOSER-ARB focuses on DeFi\ntransactions that form a cycle and performs very well for arbitrage,\nDEFIPOSER-SMT can detect more complicated profitable transactions. We estimate\nthat DEFIPOSER-ARB and DEFIPOSER-SMT can generate an average weekly revenue of\n191.48ETH (76,592USD) and 72.44ETH (28,976USD) respectively, with the highest\ntransaction revenue being 81.31ETH(32,524USD) and22.40ETH (8,960USD)\nrespectively. We further show that DEFIPOSER-SMT finds the known economic bZx\nattack from February 2020, which yields 0.48M USD. Our forensic investigations\nshow that this opportunity existed for 69 days and could have yielded more\nrevenue if exploited one day earlier. Our evaluation spans 150 days, given 96\nDeFi protocol actions, and 25 assets.\n  Looking beyond the financial gains mentioned above, forks deteriorate the\nblockchain consensus security, as they increase the risks of double-spending\nand selfish mining. We explore the implications of DEFIPOSER-ARB and\nDEFIPOSER-SMT on blockchain consensus. Specifically, we show that the trades\nidentified by our tools exceed the Ethereum block reward by up to 874x. Given\noptimal adversarial strategies provided by a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we\nquantify the value threshold at which a profitable transaction qualifies as\nMiner ExtractableValue (MEV) and would incentivize MEV-aware miners to fork the\nblockchain.

Some use cases\nare shown and specifically, based on Flashot, we study a typical Pump and\nArbitrage case and present in-depth economic explanations to the attacker's\nbehaviors. Finally, we conclude the development trends of Flash Loan attacks\nand discuss the great impact on DeFi ecosystem brought by Flash Loan. We\nenvision a brand new quantitative financial industry powered by highly\nefficient automatic risk and profit detection systems based on the blockchain.",

Yet, adversaries extract monetary value from the mesh of\ndecentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts. Some have characterized the\nEthereum peer-to-peer network as a dark forest, wherein broadcast transactions\nrepresent prey, which are devoured by generalized trading bots.\n  While transaction (re)ordering and front-running are known to cause losses to\nusers, we quantify how much value was sourced from blockchain extractable value\n(BEV). We systematize a transaction ordering taxonomy to quantify the USD\nextracted from sandwich attacks, liquidations, and decentralized exchange\narbitrage. We estimate that over 2 years, those trading activities yielded\n28.80M USD in profit, divided among 5,084 unique addresses. While arbitrage and\nliquidations might appear benign, traders can front-run others, causing\nfinancial losses to competitors.\n  To provide an example of a generalized trading bot, we show a simple yet\neffective automated transaction replay algorithm capable of replacing\nunconfirmed transactions without the need to understand the victim\ntransactions' underlying logic. We estimate that our transaction replay\nalgorithm could have yielded a profit of 51,688.33 ETH (17.60M USD) over 2\nyears on past blockchain data.\n  We also find that miners do not broadcast 1.64% of their mined transactions\nand instead choose to mine them privately. Privately mined and non-shared\ntransactions, cannot be front-run by other traders or miners. We show that the\nlargest Ethereum mining pool performs arbitrage and seemingly tries to cloak\nits private transaction mining activities. We therefore provide evidence that\nminers already extract Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which could destabilize\nthe blockchain consensus security, as related work has shown.",

Examples of such functions are the\nconstant-sum and constant-product AMMs. Existing systems however suffer from\nseveral challenges. They require external arbitrageurs to restore the price of\ntokens in the pool to match the market price. Such activities can potentially\ndrain resources from the liquidity pool. In particular, dramatic market price\nchanges can result in low liquidity with respect to one or more of the assets\nand reduce the total value of the LP. We propose in this work a new approach to\nconstructing the AMM by proposing the idea of dynamic curves. It utilizes input\nfrom a market price oracle to modify the mathematical relationship between the\nassets so that the pool price continuously and automatically adjusts to be\nidentical to the market price. This approach eliminates arbitrage opportunities\nand, as we show through simulations, maintains liquidity in the LP for all\nassets and the total value of the LP over a wide range of market prices.",

To further understand the implications of this, we investigate the\nefficiency of liquidators.

Although traditional custody\nservice is typically endorsed by centralized authorities, decentralized custody\nscheme has become technically feasible since the emergence of digital assets,\nand furthermore, it is greatly needed by new applications such as blockchain\nand DeFi (Decentralized Finance).\n  In this work, we propose a framework of decentralized asset custody scheme\nthat is able to support a large number of custodians and safely hold customer\nassets of multiple times the value of the total security deposit. The proposed\ncustody scheme distributes custodians and assets into many custodian groups via\ncombinatorial designs, where each group fully controls the assigned assets.\nSince every custodian group is small, the overhead cost is significantly\nreduced. The liveness is also improved because even a single alive group would\nbe able to process transactions.\n  The security of this custody scheme is guaranteed under the rational\nadversary model, such that any adversary corrupting a bounded fraction of\ncustodians cannot move assets more than the security deposit paid. We further\nanalyze the security and performance of our constructions from both theoretical\nand experimental sides and give explicit examples with concrete numbers and\nfigures for a better understanding of our results.",

This concept has lead to a\nnumber of interesting attack possibilities, some of which were exploited in\nFebruary 2020.\n  This paper is the first to explore the implication of transaction atomicity\nand flash loans for the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We show\nquantitatively how transaction atomicity increases the arbitrage revenue. We\nmoreover analyze two existing attacks with ROIs beyond 500k%. We formulate\nfinding the attack parameters as an optimization problem over the state of the\nunderlying Ethereum blockchain and the state of the DeFi ecosystem.

We focus on\nDeFi lending protocols as they currently constitute most of the DeFi ecosystem\nwith a 76% market share by capital as of April 15th, 2020.\n  First, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacking Maker's governance design\nto take full control of the protocol, the largest DeFi protocol by market\nshare, which would have allowed the theft of 0.5bn USD of collateral and the\nminting of an unlimited supply of DAI tokens. In doing so, we present a novel\nstrategy utilizing so-called flash loans that would have in principle allowed\nthe execution of the governance attack in just two transactions and without the\nneed to lock any assets. Approximately two weeks after we disclosed the attack\ndetails, Maker modified the governance parameters mitigating the attack\nvectors. Second, we turn to a central component of financial risk in DeFi\nlending protocols. Inspired by stress-testing as performed by central banks, we\ndevelop a stress-testing framework for a stylized DeFi lending protocol,\nfocusing our attention on the impact of a drying-up of liquidity on protocol\nsolvency.

    "title": "Frontrunner Jones and the Raiders of the Dark Forest: An Empirical Study of Frontrunning on the Ethereum Blockchain",
    "summary": "Ethereum prospered the inception of a plethora of smart contract\napplications, ranging from gambling games to decentralized finance. However,\nEthereum is also considered a highly adversarial environment, where vulnerable\nsmart contracts will eventually be exploited. Recently, Ethereum's pool of\npending transaction has become a far more aggressive environment. In the hope\nof making some profit, attackers continuously monitor the transaction pool and\ntry to frontrun their victims' transactions by either displacing or suppressing\nthem, or strategically inserting their transactions. This paper aims to shed\nsome light into what is known as a dark forest and uncover these predators'\nactions. We present a methodology to efficiently measure the three types of\nfrontrunning: displacement, insertion, and suppression. We perform a\nlarge-scale analysis on more than 11M blocks and identify almost 200K attacks\nwith an accumulated profit of 18.41M USD for the attackers, providing evidence\nthat frontrunning is both, lucrative and a prevalent issue.",

    "title": "SoK: Lending Pools in Decentralized Finance",
    "summary": "Lending pools are decentralized applications which allow mutually untrusted\nusers to lend and borrow crypto-assets. These applications feature complex,\nhighly parametric incentive mechanisms to equilibrate the loan market. This\ncomplexity makes the behaviour of lending pools difficult to understand and to\npredict: indeed, ineffective incentives and attacks could potentially lead to\nemergent unwanted behaviours. Reasoning about lending pools is made even harder\nby the lack of executable models of their behaviour: to precisely understand\nhow users interact with lending pools, eventually one has to inspect their\nimplementations, where the incentive mechanisms are intertwined with low-level\nimplementation details. Further, the variety of existing implementations makes\nit difficult to distill the common aspects of lending pools. We systematize the\nexisting knowledge about lending pools, leveraging a new formal model of\ninteractions with users, which reflects the archetypal features of mainstream\nimplementations. This enables us to prove some general properties of lending\npools, such as the correct handling of funds, and to precisely describe\nvulnerabilities and attacks. We also discuss the role of lending pools in the\nbroader context of decentralized finance.",

    "title": "Optimal Bidding Strategy for Maker Auctions",
    "summary": "The Maker Protocol is a decentralized finance application that enables\ncollateralized lending. The application uses open-bid, second-price auctions to\ncomplete its loan liquidation process. In this paper, we develop a bidding\nfunction for these auctions, focusing on the costs incurred to participate in\nthe auctions. We then optimize these costs using parameters from historical\nauction data, and compare our optimal bidding prices to the historical auction\nprices. We find that the majority of auctions end at higher prices than our\nrecommended optimal prices, and we propose several theories for these results.",

    "title": "Stablecoins 2.0: Economic Foundations and Risk-based Models",
    "summary": "Stablecoins are one of the most widely capitalized type of cryptocurrency.\nHowever, their risks vary significantly according to their design and are often\npoorly understood. We seek to provide a sound foundation for stablecoin theory,\nwith a risk-based functional characterization of the economic structure of\nstablecoins. First, we match existing economic models to the disparate set of\ncustodial systems. Next, we characterize the unique risks that emerge in\nnon-custodial stablecoins and develop a model framework that unifies existing\nmodels from economics and computer science. We further discuss how this\nmodeling framework is applicable to a wide array of cryptoeconomic systems,\nincluding cross-chain protocols, collateralized lending, and decentralized\nexchanges. These unique risks yield unanswered research questions that will\nform the crux of research in decentralized finance going forward.",

    "title": "Improved Price Oracles: Constant Function Market Makers",
    "summary": "Automated market makers, first popularized by Hanson's logarithmic market\nscoring rule (or LMSR) for prediction markets, have become important building\nblocks, called 'primitives,' for decentralized finance. A particularly useful\nprimitive is the ability to measure the price of an asset, a problem often\nknown as the pricing oracle problem. In this paper, we focus on the analysis of\na very large class of automated market makers, called constant function market\nmakers (or CFMMs) which includes existing popular market makers such as\nUniswap, Balancer, and Curve, whose yearly transaction volume totals to\nbillions of dollars. We give sufficient conditions such that, under fairly\ngeneral assumptions, agents who interact with these constant function market\nmakers are incentivized to correctly report the price of an asset and that they\ncan do so in a computationally efficient way. We also derive several other\nuseful properties that were previously not known. These include lower bounds on\nthe total value of assets held by CFMMs and lower bounds guaranteeing that no\nagent can, by any set of trades, drain the reserves of assets held by a given\nCFMM.",
