|      1|Financial intermediation and risk in decentralized lending protocols                                                        |We provide an overview of decentralized protocols like Compound and Aave that offer collateralized loans for cryptoasset investors. Compound and Aave are two of the most important application in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Using publicly available information on rates, supply and borrow activity, and accounts we analyze different elements of the protocols. In particular, we estimate ex-post margins that give a comprehensive account of the cost of financial intermediation. We find that ex-post margins considering all markets are 1% and lower for stablecoin markets. In addition, we estimate quarterly indicators regarding solvency, asset quality, earnings and market risk similar to the ones used in traditional banking. This provides a first look at the use of these metrics and a comparison between the similarities and challenges to our understanding of financial intermediation in these protocols based on tools used for traditional banking.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14678v1|   |    |
|      2|Zero-knowledge Based Proof-chain -- A methodology for blockchain-partial system                                             |Intuitively there is a drastic distinction between the pure decentralized block-chain systems like Defis and those that only utilize block-chain as an enhancing technology but remain centralized with real-world business model and conventional technologies like database, application server, etc. Our study explores extensively this distinction from a methodological point of view, classifies them into blockchain-complete and blockchain-partial, analyzes key features of the two types, and reveals the root cause of this distinction. We analyze the function or, in more strong words, the "ultimate purpose" of blockchain in the blockchain-partial systems, and present a conceptual model we named proof-chain that quite satisfactorily represented the general paradigm of blockchain in blockchain-partial systems. A universal tension between strength of proof-chain and privacy is then revealed and the zero-knowledge based proof-chain takes shape. Several case studies demonstrate the explaining power of our proof-chain methodology. We then apply proof-chain methodology to the analysis of the ecosystem of a collaborating group of blockchain-partial systems, representing the paradigm of public and private data domain whose border the proof-chain crosses. Finally, some derived guidelines from this methodology speak usefulness of our methodology.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2107.14142v1|   |    |
|      3|Training Massive Deep Neural Networks in a Smart Contract: A New Hope                                                       |Deep neural networks (DNNs) could be very useful in blockchain applications such as DeFi and NFT trading. However, training / running large-scale DNNs as part of a smart contract is infeasible on today's blockchain platforms, due to two fundamental design issues of these platforms. First, blockchains nowadays typically require that each node maintain the complete world state at any time, meaning that the node must execute all transactions in every block. This is prohibitively expensive for computationally intensive smart contracts involving DNNs. Second, existing blockchain platforms expect smart contract transactions to have deterministic, reproducible results and effects. In contrast, DNNs are usually trained / run lock-free on massively parallel computing devices such as GPUs, TPUs and / or computing clusters, which often do not yield deterministic results.   This paper proposes novel platform designs, collectively called A New Hope (ANH), that address the above issues. The main ideas are (i) computing-intensive smart contract transactions are only executed by nodes who need their results, or by specialized serviced providers, and (ii) a non-deterministic smart contract transaction leads to uncertain results, which can still be validated, though at a relatively high cost; specifically for DNNs, the validation cost can often be reduced by verifying properties of the results instead of their exact values. In addition, we discuss various implications of ANH, including its effects on token fungibility, sharding, private transactions, and the fundamental meaning of a smart contract.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14763v1|   |    |
|      4|UNISWAP: Impermanent Loss and Risk Profile of a Liquidity Provider                                                          |Uniswap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) and was first launched on November 2, 2018 on the Ethereum mainnet [1] and is part of an Ecosystem of products in Decentralized Finance (DeFi). It replaces a traditional order book type of trading common on centralized exchanges (CEX) with a deterministic model that swaps currencies (or tokens/assets) along a fixed price function determined by the amount of currencies supplied by the liquidity providers. Liquidity providers can be regarded as investors in the decentralized exchange and earn fixed commissions per trade. They lock up funds in liquidity pools for distinct pairs of currencies allowing market participants to swap them using the fixed price function. Liquidity providers take on market risk as a liquidity provider in exchange for earning commissions on each trade. Here we analyze the risk profile of a liquidity provider and the so called impermanent (unrealized) loss in particular. We provide an improved version of the commonly denoted impermanent loss function for Uniswap v2 on the semi-infinite domain. The differences between Uniswap v2 and v3 are also discussed.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.14404v1|   |    |
|      5|Flash Crash for Cash: Cyber Threats in Decentralized Finance                                                                |Decentralized Finance (DeFi) took shape in 2020. An unprecedented amount of over 14 billion USD moved into DeFi projects offering trading, loans and insurance. But its growth has also drawn the attention of malicious actors. Many projects were exploited as quickly as they launched and millions of USD were lost. While many developers understand integer overflows and reentrancy attacks, security threats to the DeFi ecosystem are more complex and still poorly understood. In this paper we provide the first overview of in-the-wild DeFi security incidents. We observe that many of these exploits are market attacks, weaponizing weakly implemented business logic in one protocol with credit provided by another to inflate appropriations. Rather than misusing individual protocols, attackers increasingly use DeFi's strength of permissionless composability against itself. By providing the first holistic analysis of real-world security incidents within the nascent financial ecosystem DeFi is, we hope to inform threat modeling in decentralized cryptoeconomic initiatives in the years ahead.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.10740v1|   |    |
|      6|CeFi vs. DeFi -- Comparing Centralized to Decentralized Finance                                                             |To non-experts, the traditional Centralized Finance (CeFi) ecosystem may seem obscure, because users are typically not aware of the underlying rules or agreements of financial assets and products. Decentralized Finance (DeFi), however, is making its debut as an ecosystem claiming to offer transparency and control, which are partially attributable to the underlying integrity-protected blockchain, as well as currently higher financial asset yields than CeFi. Yet, the boundaries between CeFi and DeFi may not be always so clear cut.   In this work, we systematically analyze the differences between CeFi and DeFi, covering legal, economic, security, privacy and market manipulation. We provide a structured methodology to differentiate between a CeFi and a DeFi service. Our findings show that certain DeFi assets (such as USDC or USDT stablecoins) do not necessarily classify as DeFi assets, and may endanger the economic security of intertwined DeFi protocols. We conclude this work with the exploration of possible synergies between CeFi and DeFi.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.08157v2|   |    |
|      7|An Empirical Study of DeFi Liquidations: Incentives, Risks, and Instabilities                                               |Financial speculators often seek to increase their potential gains with leverage. Debt is a popular form of leverage, and with over 39.88B USD of total value locked (TVL), the Decentralized Finance (DeFi) lending markets are thriving. Debts, however, entail the risks of liquidation, the process of selling the debt collateral at a discount to liquidators. Nevertheless, few quantitative insights are known about the existing liquidation mechanisms.   In this paper, to the best of our knowledge, we are the first to study the breadth of the borrowing and lending markets of the Ethereum DeFi ecosystem. We focus on Aave, Compound, MakerDAO, and dYdX, which collectively represent over 85% of the lending market on Ethereum. Given extensive liquidation data measurements and insights, we systematize the prevalent liquidation mechanisms and are the first to provide a methodology to compare them objectively. We find that the existing liquidation designs well incentivize liquidators but sell excessive amounts of discounted collateral at the borrowers' expenses. We measure various risks that liquidation participants are exposed to and quantify the instabilities of existing lending protocols. Moreover, we propose an optimal strategy that allows liquidators to increase their liquidation profit, which may aggravate the loss of borrowers.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.06389v1|   |    |

AMMs are one of the most successful DeFi use case so far, as the main AMM platforms UniSwap and Balancer process a daily volume of transactions worth billions of dollars. Despite this success story, AMMs are well-known to suffer from transaction-ordering issues: indeed, adversaries can frontrun user transactions to increase their gain to the detriment of honest users. Being specifically designated to arrange user transactions into blocks, miners can easily play the role of adversary, by suitably selecting and ordering transactions - and possibly inserting their own - to increase their gain. In this paper we formally characterize rational miners as players which follow an optimal strategy in the mining game. We identify relevant variants of the game, corresponding to specific real-world constraints that a miner might have. We devise effective procedures to construct solutions to mining game, both in its most general form and in some relevant variants. Most notably, miners can exploit these solutions to maximize the value extracted from user transactions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.01870v1|   |    |

In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we study a general framework for yield farming strategies with empirical analysis. First, we summarize the fundamentals of yield farming by focusing on the protocols and tokens used by aggregators. We then examine the sources of yield and translate those into three example yield farming strategies, followed by the simulations of yield farming performance, based on these strategies. We further compare four major yield aggregrators -- Idle, Pickle, Harvest and Yearn -- in the ecosystem, along with brief introductions of others. We systematize their strategies and revenue models, and conduct an empirical analysis with on-chain data from example vaults, to find a plausible connection between data anomalies and historical events. Finally, we discuss the benefits and risks of yield aggregators.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.13891v2|   |    |

At the same time, attacks towards DeFi applications (apps) are increasing. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing smart contract vulnerability detection tools cannot be directly used to detect DeFi attacks. That's because they lack the capability to recover and understand high-level DeFi semantics, e.g., a user trades a token pair X and Y in a Decentralized EXchange (DEX).   In this work, we focus on the detection of two types of new attacks on DeFi apps, including direct and indirect price manipulation attacks. The former one means that an attacker directly manipulates the token price in DEX by performing an unwanted trade in the same DEX by attacking the vulnerable DeFi app. The latter one means that an attacker indirectly manipulates the token price of the vulnerable DeFi app (e.g., a lending app). To this end, we propose a platform-independent way to recover high-level DeFi semantics by first constructing the cash flow tree from raw Ethereum transactions and then lifting the low-level semantics to high-level ones, including token trade, liquidity mining, and liquidity cancel. Finally, we detect price manipulation attacks using the patterns expressed with the recovered DeFi semantics.   We have implemented a prototype named \tool{} and applied it to more than 350 million transactions. It successfully detected 432 real-world attacks in the wild. We confirm that they belong to four known security incidents and five zero-day ones. We reported our findings. Two CVEs have been assigned. We further performed an attack analysis to reveal the root cause of the vulnerability, the attack footprint, and the impact of the attack. Our work urges the need to secure the DeFi ecosystem.                                                                              |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.15068v1|   |    |

As an integral part of the decentralised finance (DeFi) ecosystem, lending protocols are gaining tremendous traction, holding an aggregate liquidity supply of over $40 billion at the time of writing. In this paper, we enumerate the challenges of traditional money markets led by banks and lending platforms, and present advantageous characteristics of DeFi lending protocols that might help resolve deep-rooted issues in the conventional lending environment. With the examples of Maker, Compound and Aave, we describe in detail the mechanism of DeFi lending protocols. We discuss the persisting reliance of DeFi lending on the traditional financial system, and conclude with the outlook of the lending market in the IOV era.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2104.00970v2|   |    |

Yet, their theoretical properties are curiously homogeneous when a set of basic assumptions are met. In this paper, we start by presenting a universal approach to deriving a formula for liquidity provisioning for AMMs. Next, we show that the constant function market maker and token swap market maker models are theoretically equivalent when liquidity reserves are uniform. Proceeding with an examination of AMM market microstructure, we show how non-linear price effect translates into slippage for traders and impermanent losses for liquidity providers. We proceed by showing how impermanent losses are a function of both volatility and market depth and discuss the implications of these findings within the context of the literature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2105.02782v1|   |    |

Most prominently, the top six AMMs -- Uniswap, Balancer, Curve, DODO, Bancor and Sushiswap -- hold in aggregate 15 billion USD worth of crypto-assets as of March 2021. Instead of matching the buy and sell sides, AMMs employ a peer-to-pool method and determine asset price algorithmically through a so-called conservation function. Compared to centralized exchanges, AMMs exhibit the apparent advantage of decentralization, automation and continuous liquidity. Nonetheless, AMMs typically feature drawbacks such as high slippage for traders and divergence loss for liquidity providers. This work establishes a general AMM framework describing the economics and formalizing the system's state-space representation. We employ our framework to systematically compare the top AMM protocols' mechanics, deriving their slippage and divergence loss functions.

Compared to the traditional finance, DeFi allows customers to flexibly participate in diverse blockchain financial services (e.g., lending, borrowing, collateralizing, exchanging etc.) via smart contracts at a relatively low cost of trust. However, the open nature of DeFi inevitably introduces a large attack surface, which is a severe threat to the security of participants funds. In this paper, we proposed BLOCKEYE, a real-time attack detection system for DeFi projects on the Ethereum blockchain. Key capabilities provided by BLOCKEYE are twofold: (1) Potentially vulnerable DeFi projects are identified based on an automatic security analysis process, which performs symbolic reasoning on the data flow of important service states, e.g., asset price, and checks whether they can be externally manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is installed offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project. Transactions sent not only to that project but other associated projects as well are collected for further security analysis. A potential attack is flagged if a violation is detected on a critical invariant configured in BLOCKEYE, e.g., Benefit is achieved within a very short time and way much bigger than the cost. We applied BLOCKEYE in several popular DeFi projects and managed to discover potential security attacks that are unreported before. A video of BLOCKEYE is available at https://youtu.be/7DjsWBLdlQU.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02873v1|   |    |
|     15|On the Just-In-Time Discovery of Profit-Generating Transactions in DeFi Protocols                                           |In this paper, we investigate two methods that allow us to automatically create profitable DeFi trades, one well-suited to arbitrage and the other applicable to more complicated settings. We first adopt the Bellman-Ford-Moore algorithm with DEFIPOSER-ARB and then create logical DeFi protocol models for a theorem prover in DEFIPOSER-SMT. While DEFIPOSER-ARB focuses on DeFi transactions that form a cycle and performs very well for arbitrage, DEFIPOSER-SMT can detect more complicated profitable transactions. We estimate that DEFIPOSER-ARB and DEFIPOSER-SMT can generate an average weekly revenue of 191.48ETH (76,592USD) and 72.44ETH (28,976USD) respectively, with the highest transaction revenue being 81.31ETH(32,524USD) and22.40ETH (8,960USD) respectively. We further show that DEFIPOSER-SMT finds the known economic bZx attack from February 2020, which yields 0.48M USD. Our forensic investigations show that this opportunity existed for 69 days and could have yielded more revenue if exploited one day earlier. Our evaluation spans 150 days, given 96 DeFi protocol actions, and 25 assets.   Looking beyond the financial gains mentioned above, forks deteriorate the blockchain consensus security, as they increase the risks of double-spending and selfish mining. We explore the implications of DEFIPOSER-ARB and DEFIPOSER-SMT on blockchain consensus. Specifically, we show that the trades identified by our tools exceed the Ethereum block reward by up to 874x. Given optimal adversarial strategies provided by a Markov Decision Process (MDP), we quantify the value threshold at which a profitable transaction qualifies as Miner ExtractableValue (MEV) and would incentivize MEV-aware miners to fork the blockchain. For instance, we find that on Ethereum, a miner with a hash rate of 10% would fork the blockchain if an MEV opportunity exceeds 4x the block reward.|http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02228v1|   |    |

To address this challenge, we present SciviK, a versatile framework for specifying and verifying industrial-grade smart contracts. SciviK's versatile approach extends previous efforts with three key contributions: (i) an expressive annotation system enabling built-in directives for vulnerability pattern checking, neural-based loop invariant inference, and the verification of rich properties of real-world smart contracts (ii) a fine-grained model for the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that provides low-level execution semantics, (iii) an IR-level verification framework integrating both SMT solvers and the Coq proof assistant.   We use SciviK to specify and verify security properties for 12 benchmark contracts and a real-world Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contract. Among all 158 specified security properties (in six types), 151 properties can be automatically verified within 2 seconds, five properties can be automatically verified after moderate modifications, and two properties are manually proved with around 200 lines of Coq code.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.02209v1|   |    |

The DeFi ecosystem enables a wide range of crypto-financial activities, while the underlying smart contracts often contain bugs, with many vulnerabilities arising from the unforeseen consequences of composing DeFi protocols together. In this paper, we propose a formal process-algebraic technique that models DeFi protocols in a compositional manner to allow for efficient property verification. We also conduct a case study to demonstrate the proposed approach in analyzing the composition of two interacting DeFi protocols, namely, Curve and Compound. Finally, we discuss how the proposed modeling and verification approach can be used to analyze financial and security properties of interest.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.00540v2|   |    |

By employing core functions of the 'Dai Stablecoin system' deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, we produce the equivalent exposure of a leveraged position while deterministically automating the monitoring and liquidation processes. We demonstrate the implementation and early integration of the artefact into a hardened exchange environment through a microservice utilizing standardized API calls. The early results presented in this paper were produced in collaboration with a team of stakeholders at a hosting organization, a multi-national online brokerage and cryptocurrency exchange. We utilize the design science research methodology (DSR) guiding the design, development, and evaluation of the artefact. Our findings indicate that, while it is feasible to implement the lifecycle of a leveraged trade on the blockchain, the integration of the artefact into a traditional exchange environment involves multiple compromises and drawback. Generalizing the tentative findings presented in this paper, we introduce three propositions on the implementation, integration, and implications of executing key business processes with permissionless blockchain technologies.

They allow users to exchange units of different types of crypto-assets, without the need to find a counter-party. There are several implementations and models for AMMs, featuring a variety of sophisticated economic mechanisms. We present a theory of AMMs. The core of our theory is an abstract operational model of the interactions between users and AMMs, which can be instantiated with any desired economic design mechanism. We exploit our theory to formally prove a set of fundamental properties of AMMs, characterizing both structural and economic aspects. We do this by abstracting from the actual economic mechanisms used in implementations, by identifying sufficient conditions which ensure the relevant properties. Notably, we devise a general solution to the arbitrage problem, the main game-theoretic foundation behind the economic mechanisms of AMMs.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.11350v2|   |    |

Stakeholders can deposit claims on assets, referred to as 'liquidity shares', across applications producing effects equivalent to rehypothecation in traditional financial systems. We seek to understand the degree to which this practice may contribute to financial integration on Ethereum by examining transactions in 'composed' derivatives for the assets DAI, USDC, USDT, ETH and tokenized BTC for the full set of 344.8 million Ethereum transactions computed in 2020.

|     21|How Decentralized is the Governance of Blockchain-based Finance: Empirical Evidence from four Governance Token Distributions|Novel blockchain technology provides the infrastructure layer for the creation of decentralized appli-cations. A rapidly growing ecosystem of applications is built around financial services, commonly referred to as decentralized finance. Whereas the intangible concept of decentralization is presented as a key driver for the applications, defining and measuring decentralization is multifaceted. This pa-per provides a framework to quantify decentralization of governance power among blockchain appli-cations. Governance of the applications is increasingly important and requires striking a balance be-tween broad distribution, fostering user activity, and financial incentives. Therefore, we aggregate, parse, and analyze empirical data of four finance applications calculating coefficients for the statistical dispersion of the governance token distribution. The gauges potentially support IS scholars for an objective evaluation of the capabilities and limitations of token governance and for fast iteration in design-driven governance mechanisms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.10096v2|   |    |

It has also demonstrated an exciting opportunity that a huge wealth could be created by composing DeFi's building blocks and exploring the arbitrage change. However, a fundamental framework to study the field of DeFi has not yet reached a consensus and there's a lack of standard tools or languages to help better describe, design and improve the running processes of the infant DeFi systems, which naturally makes it harder to understand the basic principles behind the complexity of Flash Loan attacks.   In this paper, we are the first to propose Flashot, a prototype that is able to transparently illustrate the precise asset flows intertwined with smart contracts in a standardized diagram for each Flash Loan event. Some use cases are shown and specifically, based on Flashot, we study a typical Pump and Arbitrage case and present in-depth economic explanations to the attacker's behaviors. Finally, we conclude the development trends of Flash Loan attacks and discuss the great impact on DeFi ecosystem brought by Flash Loan. We envision a brand new quantitative financial industry powered by highly efficient automatic risk and profit detection systems based on the blockchain.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.00626v1|   |    |

One year ago the total value locked in DeFi systems was approximately 700m USD, now, as of April 2021, it stands at around 51bn USD. The frenetic evolution of the ecosystem makes it challenging for newcomers to gain an understanding of its basic features. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we delineate the DeFi ecosystem along its principal axes. First, we provide an overview of the DeFi primitives. Second, we classify DeFi protocols according to the type of operation they provide. We then go on to consider in detail the technical and economic security of DeFi protocols, drawing particular attention to the issues that emerge specifically in the DeFi setting. Finally, we outline the open research challenges in the ecosystem.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08778v3|   |    |

The possibility to execute small programs, called smart contracts, on cryptocurrencies like Ethereum opened doors to countless new applications. One particular exciting use case is decentralized finance (DeFi), which aims to revolutionize traditional financial services by founding them on a decentralized infrastructure. We show the potential of DeFi by analyzing its advantages compared to traditional finance. Additionally, we survey the state-of-the-art of DeFi products and categorize existing services. Since DeFi is still in its infancy, there are countless hurdles for mass adoption. We discuss the most prominent challenges and point out possible solutions. Finally, we analyze the economics behind DeFi products. By carefully analyzing the state-of-the-art and discussing current challenges, we give a perspective on how the DeFi space might develop in the near future.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05589v1|   |    |
|     25|Quantifying Blockchain Extractable Value: How dark is the forest?                                                           |Permissionless blockchains such as Bitcoin have excelled at financial services. Yet, adversaries extract monetary value from the mesh of decentralized finance (DeFi) smart contracts. Some have characterized the Ethereum peer-to-peer network as a dark forest, wherein broadcast transactions represent prey, which are devoured by generalized trading bots.   While transaction (re)ordering and front-running are known to cause losses to users, we quantify how much value was sourced from blockchain extractable value (BEV). We systematize a transaction ordering taxonomy to quantify the USD extracted from sandwich attacks, liquidations, and decentralized exchange arbitrage. We estimate that over 2 years, those trading activities yielded 28.80M USD in profit, divided among 5,084 unique addresses. While arbitrage and liquidations might appear benign, traders can front-run others, causing financial losses to competitors.   To provide an example of a generalized trading bot, we show a simple yet effective automated transaction replay algorithm capable of replacing unconfirmed transactions without the need to understand the victim transactions' underlying logic. We estimate that our transaction replay algorithm could have yielded a profit of 51,688.33 ETH (17.60M USD) over 2 years on past blockchain data.   We also find that miners do not broadcast 1.64% of their mined transactions and instead choose to mine them privately. Privately mined and non-shared transactions, cannot be front-run by other traders or miners. We show that the largest Ethereum mining pool performs arbitrage and seemingly tries to cloak its private transaction mining activities. We therefore provide evidence that miners already extract Miner Extractable Value (MEV), which could destabilize the blockchain consensus security, as related work has shown.                                |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.05511v3|   |    |
|     26|Dynamic Curves for Decentralized Autonomous Cryptocurrency Exchanges                                                        |One of the exciting recent developments in decentralized finance (DeFi) has been the development of decentralized cryptocurrency exchanges that can autonomously handle conversion between different cryptocurrencies. Decentralized exchange protocols such as Uniswap, Curve and other types of Automated Market Makers (AMMs) maintain a liquidity pool (LP) of two or more assets constrained to maintain at all times a mathematical relation to each other, defined by a given function or curve. Examples of such functions are the constant-sum and constant-product AMMs. Existing systems however suffer from several challenges. They require external arbitrageurs to restore the price of tokens in the pool to match the market price. Such activities can potentially drain resources from the liquidity pool. In particular, dramatic market price changes can result in low liquidity with respect to one or more of the assets and reduce the total value of the LP. We propose in this work a new approach to constructing the AMM by proposing the idea of dynamic curves. It utilizes input from a market price oracle to modify the mathematical relationship between the assets so that the pool price continuously and automatically adjusts to be identical to the market price. This approach eliminates arbitrage opportunities and, as we show through simulations, maintains liquidity in the LP for all assets and the total value of the LP over a wide range of market prices.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.02778v1|   |    |
|     27|Decentralized Finance, Centralized Ownership? An Iterative Mapping Process to Measure Protocol Token Distribution           |In this paper, we analyze various Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols in terms of their token distributions. We propose an iterative mapping process that allows us to split aggregate token holdings from custodial and escrow contracts and assign them to their economic beneficiaries. This method accounts for liquidity-, lending-, and staking-pools, as well as token wrappers, and can be used to break down token holdings, even for high nesting levels. We compute individual address balances for several snapshots and analyze intertemporal distribution changes. In addition, we study reallocation and protocol usage data, and propose a proxy for measuring token dependencies and ecosystem integration. The paper offers new insights on DeFi interoperability as well as token ownership distribution and may serve as a foundation for further research.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09306v1|   |    |

As part of this, we implement an optimisation pass removing unused arguments. We prove the pass correct wrt. a conventional call-by-value operational semantics of functional languages. We apply this to two functional smart contract languages, Liquidity and Midlang, and to the functional language Elm. Our development is done in the context of the ConCert framework that enables smart contract verification. We contribute a verified boardroom voting smart contract featuring maximum voter privacy such that each vote is kept private except under collusion of all other parties. We also integrate property-based testing into ConCert using QuickChick and our development is the first to support testing properties of interacting smart contracts. We test several complex contracts such as a DAO-like contract, an escrow contract, an implementation of a Decentralized Finance (DeFi) contract which includes a custom token standard (Tezos FA2), and more. In total, this gives us a way to write dependent programs in Coq, test them semi-automatically, verify, and then extract to functional smart contract languages, while retaining a small trusted computing base of only MetaCoq and the pretty-printers into these languages.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.09138v2|   |    |
|     29|Exploring Narrative Economics: An Agent-Based-Modeling Platform that Integrates Automated Traders with Opinion Dynamics     |In seeking to explain aspects of real-world economies that defy easy understanding when analysed via conventional means, Nobel Laureate Robert Shiller has since 2017 introduced and developed the idea of Narrative Economics, where observable economic factors such as the dynamics of prices in asset markets are explained largely as a consequence of the narratives (i.e., the stories) heard, told, and believed by participants in those markets. Shiller argues that otherwise irrational and difficult-to-explain behaviors, such as investors participating in highly volatile cryptocurrency markets, are best explained and understood in narrative terms: people invest because they believe, because they have a heartfelt opinions, about the future prospects of the asset, and they tell to themselves and others stories (narratives) about those beliefs and opinions. In this paper we describe what is, to the best of our knowledge, the first ever agent-based modelling platform that allows for the study of issues in narrative economics. We have created this by integrating and synthesizing research in two previously separate fields: opinion dynamics (OD), and agent-based computational economics (ACE) in the form of minimally-intelligent trader-agents operating in accurately modelled financial markets. We show here for the first time how long-established models in OD and in ACE can be brought together to enable the experimental study of issues in narrative economics, and we present initial results from our system. The program-code for our simulation platform has been released as freely-available open-source software on GitHub, to enable other researchers to replicate and extend our work                                                                                                                                                                                  |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2012.08840v1|   |    |
|     30|Towards A First Step to Understand Flash Loan and Its Applications in DeFi Ecosystem                                        |Flash Loan, as an emerging service in the decentralized finance ecosystem, allows users to request a non-collateral loan. While providing convenience, it also enables attackers to launch malicious operations with a large amount of asset that they do not have. Though there exist spot media reports of attacks that leverage Flash Loan, there lacks a comprehensive understanding of existing Flash Loan services. In this work, we take the first step to study the Flash Loan service provided by three popular platforms. Specifically, we first illustrate the interactions between Flash Loan providers and users. Then, we design three patterns to identify Flash Loan transactions. Based on the patterns, 76, 303 transactions are determined. The evaluation results show that the Flash Loan services get more popular over time. At last, we present four Flash Loan applications with real-world examples and propose two potential research directions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.12252v3|   |    |
|     31|AMR:Autonomous Coin Mixer with Privacy Preserving Reward Distribution                                                       |It is well known that users on open blockchains are tracked by an industry providing services to governments, law enforcement, secret services, and alike. While most blockchains do not protect their users' privacy and allow external observers to link transactions and addresses, a growing research interest attempts to design add-on privacy solutions to help users regain their privacy on non-private blockchains.   In this work, we propose to our knowledge the first censorship resilient mixer, which can reward its users in a privacy-preserving manner for participating in the system. Increasing the anonymity set size, and diversity of users, is, as we believe, an important endeavor to raise a mixer's contributed privacy in practice. The paid-out rewards can take the form of governance tokens to decentralize the voting on system parameters, similar to how popular "DeFi farming" protocols operate. Moreover, by leveraging existing "Defi" lending platforms, AMR is the first mixer design that allows participating clients to earn financial interests on their deposited funds.   Our system AMR is autonomous as it does not rely on any external server or third party. The evaluation of our AMR implementation shows that the system supports today on Ethereum anonymity set sizes beyond thousands of users, and a capacity of over $66,000$ deposits per day, at constant system costs. We provide a formal specification of our zksnark-based AMR system, a privacy and security analysis, implementation, and evaluation with both the MiMC and Poseidon hash functions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.01056v3|   |    |

Nonetheless, factors such as price volatility may undermine this mechanism. In order to protect protocols from suffering losses, undercollateralized positions can be liquidated. In this paper, we present the first in-depth empirical analysis of liquidations on protocols for loanable funds (PLFs). We examine Compound, one of the most widely used PLFs, for a period starting from its conception to September 2020. We analyze participants' behavior and risk-appetite in particular, to elucidate recent developments in the dynamics of the protocol. Furthermore, we assess how this has changed with a modification in Compound's incentive structure and show that variations of only 3% in an asset's dollar price can result in over 10m USD becoming liquidable. To further understand the implications of this, we investigate the efficiency of liquidators. We find that liquidators' efficiency has improved significantly over time, with currently over 70% of liquidable positions being immediately liquidated. Lastly, we provide a discussion on how a false sense of security fostered by a misconception of the stability of non-custodial stablecoins, increases the overall liquidation risk faced by Compound participants.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.13235v5|   |    |
|     33|Automated Market Makers for Decentralized Finance (DeFi)                                                                    |This paper compares mathematical models for automated market makers including logarithmic market scoring rule (LMSR), liquidity sensitive LMSR (LS-LMSR), constant product/mean/sum, and others. It is shown that though LMSR may not be a good model for Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications, LS-LMSR has several advantages over constant product/mean based automated market makers. However, LS-LMSR requires complicated computation (i.e., logarithm and exponentiation) and the cost function curve is concave. In certain DeFi applications, it is preferred to have computationally efficient cost functions with convex curves to conform with the principle of supply and demand. This paper proposes and analyzes constant circle/ellipse based cost functions for automated market makers. The proposed cost functions are computationally efficient (only requires multiplication and square root calculation) and have several advantages over widely deployed constant product cost functions. For example, the proposed market makers are more robust against front-runner (slippage) attacks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2009.01676v2|   |    |
|     34|Decentralized Asset Custody Scheme with Security against Rational Adversary                                                 |Asset custody is a core financial service in which the custodian holds in-safekeeping assets on behalf of the client. Although traditional custody service is typically endorsed by centralized authorities, decentralized custody scheme has become technically feasible since the emergence of digital assets, and furthermore, it is greatly needed by new applications such as blockchain and DeFi (Decentralized Finance).   In this work, we propose a framework of decentralized asset custody scheme that is able to support a large number of custodians and safely hold customer assets of multiple times the value of the total security deposit. The proposed custody scheme distributes custodians and assets into many custodian groups via combinatorial designs, where each group fully controls the assigned assets. Since every custodian group is small, the overhead cost is significantly reduced. The liveness is also improved because even a single alive group would be able to process transactions.   The security of this custody scheme is guaranteed under the rational adversary model, such that any adversary corrupting a bounded fraction of custodians cannot move assets more than the security deposit paid. We further analyze the security and performance of our constructions from both theoretical and experimental sides and give explicit examples with concrete numbers and figures for a better understanding of our results.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2008.10895v3|   |    |

Recent work illustrates that Proof of Stake (PoS) is vulnerable to financial attacks arising from on-chain lending and has worse capital efficiency than Proof of Work (PoW) \cite{fanti_pos_econ}. Numerous methods for improving capital efficiency have been proposed that allow stakers to create fungible derivative claims on their staked assets. In this paper, we construct a unifying model for studying the security risks of these proposals. This model combines birth-death P\'olya processes and risk models adapted from the credit derivatives literature to assess token inequality and return profiles. We find that there is a sharp transition between 'safe' and 'unsafe' derivative usage. Surprisingly, we find that contrary to \cite{fanti2019compounding} there exist conditions where derivatives can \emph{reduce} concentration of wealth in these networks. This model also applies to Decentralized Finance (DeFi) protocols where staked assets are used as insurance. Our theoretical results are validated using agent-based simulation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.11156v1|   |    |
|     36|DeFi Protocols for Loanable Funds: Interest Rates, Liquidity and Market Efficiency                                          |We coin the term *Protocols for Loanable Funds (PLFs)* to refer to protocols which establish distributed ledger-based markets for loanable funds. PLFs are emerging as one of the main applications within Decentralized Finance (DeFi), and use smart contract code to facilitate the intermediation of loanable funds. In doing so, these protocols allow agents to borrow and save programmatically. Within these protocols, interest rate mechanisms seek to equilibrate the supply and demand for funds. In this paper, we review the methodologies used to set interest rates on three prominent DeFi PLFs, namely Compound, Aave and dYdX. We provide an empirical examination of how these interest rate rules have behaved since their inception in response to differing degrees of liquidity. We then investigate the market efficiency and inter-connectedness between multiple protocols, examining first whether Uncovered Interest Parity holds within a particular protocol and second whether the interest rates for a particular token market show dependence across protocols, developing a Vector Error Correction Model for the dynamics.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.13922v3|   |    |

However, these protocols often require critical external information, like currency or commodity exchange rates, and in this respect they rely on special oracle nodes. In this paper, we present the first study of DeFi oracles deployed in practice. First, we investigate designs of mainstream DeFi platforms that rely on data from oracles. We find that these designs, surprisingly, position oracles as trusted parties with no or low accountability. Then, we present results of large-scale measurements of deployed oracles. We find and report that prices reported by oracles regularly deviate from current exchange rates, oracles are not free from operational issues, and their reports include anomalies. Finally, we compare the oracle designs and propose potential improvements.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04377v3|   |    |
|     38|A Human Dimension of Hacking: Social Engineering through Social Media                                                       |Social engineering through social media channels targeting organizational employees is emerging as one of the most challenging information security threats. Social engineering defies traditional security efforts due to the method of attack relying on human naivet\'e or error. The vast amount of information now made available to social engineers through online social networks is facilitating methods of attack which rely on some form of human error to enable infiltration into company networks. While, paramount to organisational information security objectives is the introduction of relevant comprehensive policy and guideline, perspectives and practices vary from global region to region. This paper identifies such regional variations and then presents a detailed investigation on information security outlooks and practices, surrounding social media, in Australian organisations (both public and private). Results detected disparate views and practices, suggesting further work is needed to achieve effective protection against security threats arsing due to social media adoption.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.04049v1|   |    |
|     39|Attacking the DeFi Ecosystem with Flash Loans for Fun and Profit                                                            |Credit allows a lender to loan out surplus capital to a borrower. In the traditional economy, credit bears the risk that the borrower may default on its debt, the lender hence requires upfront collateral from the borrower, plus interest fee payments. Due to the atomicity of blockchain transactions, lenders can offer flash loans, i.e., loans that are only valid within one transaction and must be repaid by the end of that transaction. This concept has lead to a number of interesting attack possibilities, some of which were exploited in February 2020.   This paper is the first to explore the implication of transaction atomicity and flash loans for the nascent decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. We show quantitatively how transaction atomicity increases the arbitrage revenue. We moreover analyze two existing attacks with ROIs beyond 500k%. We formulate finding the attack parameters as an optimization problem over the state of the underlying Ethereum blockchain and the state of the DeFi ecosystem. We show how malicious adversaries can efficiently maximize an attack profit and hence damage the DeFi ecosystem further. Specifically, we present how two previously executed attacks can be "boosted" to result in a profit of 829.5k USD and 1.1M USD, respectively, which is a boost of 2.37x and 1.73x, respectively.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.03810v4|   |    |
|     40|The Decentralized Financial Crisis                                                                                          |The Global Financial Crisis of 2008, caused by the accumulation of excessive financial risk, inspired Satoshi Nakamoto to create Bitcoin. Now, more than ten years later, Decentralized Finance (DeFi), a peer-to-peer financial paradigm which leverages blockchain-based smart contracts to ensure its integrity and security, contains over 702m USD of capital as of April 15th, 2020. As this ecosystem develops, it is at risk of the very sort of financial meltdown it is supposed to be preventing. In this paper we explore how design weaknesses and price fluctuations in DeFi protocols could lead to a DeFi crisis. We focus on DeFi lending protocols as they currently constitute most of the DeFi ecosystem with a 76% market share by capital as of April 15th, 2020.   First, we demonstrate the feasibility of attacking Maker's governance design to take full control of the protocol, the largest DeFi protocol by market share, which would have allowed the theft of 0.5bn USD of collateral and the minting of an unlimited supply of DAI tokens. In doing so, we present a novel strategy utilizing so-called flash loans that would have in principle allowed the execution of the governance attack in just two transactions and without the need to lock any assets. Approximately two weeks after we disclosed the attack details, Maker modified the governance parameters mitigating the attack vectors. Second, we turn to a central component of financial risk in DeFi lending protocols. Inspired by stress-testing as performed by central banks, we develop a stress-testing framework for a stylized DeFi lending protocol, focusing our attention on the impact of a drying-up of liquidity on protocol solvency. Based on our parameters, we find that with sufficiently illiquidity a lending protocol with a total debt of 400m USD could become undercollateralized within 19 days.             |http://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.08099v2|   |    |
|     41|Potential applications of Distributed Ledger Technology to the Defence Support Network                                      |Proponents of Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) claim it could have an impact greater than the internet; a breakthrough defying organisational boundaries by securely storing data across trustless entities. This would allow decisions to be made on verifiable data in an automated manner without the costs imposed by middlemen, with a corresponding economy-wide impact. Despite this potential, real-world application is embryonic with public and private sectors rapidly seeking exploitation opportunities. This research seeks to understand how DLT might apply to the Defence Support Network (DSN), the mechanism used to sustain UK Armed Forces with materiel and equipment. Drawing on academic and commercial models, a framework was produced for evaluating DLT use cases which measures utility, ease of implementation and impact. Using a functionalist research paradigm, interviews were conducted with DLT and DSN experts on potential use cases, the data from which was then analysed against a lightweight version of the evaluation framework. Results show that use cases involving codification, certification and supply chain provenance merit further investigation. The research concluded with recommendations that the DSN should pilot DLT use cases, but these should be carefully selected utilising an evaluation framework due to DLT's emergent nature.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |http://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.11471v1|   |    |
